Hey thanks for checking out my page! My name is Zach. I've been a Software Engineer for over a decade now.
Most of my career I've spent in the Java world. Everything from desktop Swing applications to web services handling millions of requests a day. 

In my spare time I jump into whatever languages or frameworks have caught my interest at the time. I'm currently on an Elixir/Phoenix kick with some Rust on the side. Next week/month I may be on to something else.

My posts here may span a range of topics, probably things I'm not an expert in because that's more fun for me. If you find any mistakes or have any suggestions (or better yet if you like something I've posted) feel free to drop me a line on Twitter, leave a comment, or send a pull request on github.
