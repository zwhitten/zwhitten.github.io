I didn’t have a compelling technical reason for doing so, but since I was looking to upgrade the asthetic anyway I figured I’d give Gatsby a shot.\nI don’t use Ruby too often these days, but do a fair amount of work in React and Redux so it does seem like Gatsby will prove to be a little easier to extend and modify. </p>\n<p>Since the handful of posts I had were markdown already the migration was extremely easy. I pulled down a Gatsby blog template site (which already had the markdown rendering package included), and basically put my posts into the “gatsby” content directory structure. </p>\n<p>I was able to strip down the template I chose by removing dependencies for things like Facebook, Algolia, and netlify. Nothing against those sites (well maybe <em>something</em> against FB) but I wasn’t interested in using them right now. It was also very easy to add <code class=\"language-text\">npm</code> plugins for disqus and google analytics which was nice. </p>\n<p>I’ll probably continue playing around with Gatsby and seeing what other plugins and packages the community has out there. Stay tuned!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/transition-to-gatsby","tagSlugs":["/tag/misc/","/tag/jekyll/","/tag/gatsby/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2018-12-08","description":null,"tags":["misc","jekyll","gatsby"],"title":"Migrating from Jekyll to Gatsby","socialImage":"/media/dominic-dreier-340662-unsplash.jpg"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/posts/transition-to-gatsby"}}}
