&lt;p&gt;When I first started this blog I used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pages-themes/slate&quot;&gt;slate&lt;/a&gt; theme since it was suppored by github pages. Out of the box this is great since it gave a clean interface with basically zero work; however, making even simple changes required a lot more work than I thought they should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current iteration of Jekyll obscures a lot of whatâ€™s happening with the themes and overriding styles required basically pulling down the git repo of the theme, including the various layouts and styles, and then making the tweaks I desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was not a fan of this, so I refactored most of the styling to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://getbootstrap.com/&quot;&gt;bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; instead. The look of the site is virtually unchanged, but my piece of mind is much improved.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll-theme" /><category term="jekyll" /><category term="bootstrap" /><summary type="html">Just a quick note to anyone who stumbles across the git history of this site.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Eventually I will have real posts!</title><link href="/2017/05/14/eventually-i-will-have-real-posts.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Eventually I will have real posts!" /><published>2017-05-14T09:15:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-05-14T09:15:00-04:00</updated><id>/2017/05/14/eventually-i-will-have-real-posts</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2017/05/14/eventually-i-will-have-real-posts.html">&lt;p&gt;Slowly but surely making progress.
